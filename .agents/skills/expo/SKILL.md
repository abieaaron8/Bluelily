# Expo

Read [expo-overview](references/expo-overview.md) for shared setup rules, then load the references that match the user's goal. Expo documentation and the installed Expo and EAS CLIs are the source of truth.

Former Expo and EAS skill names refer to the workflow files below. Load those references when an imported instruction asks for another skill or its SKILL.md. Paths in workflow references are relative to that reference; `<skill-root>` means this combined expo directory. The upstream overview mentions expo-tailwind-setup, which is not present in this source collection; consult current Expo documentation for that topic.

This package contains skill instructions and helper scripts. Plugin MCP configuration and telemetry hooks are not installed by this package.

## Start Here

Load this first for any Expo/EAS task, then route to the specific skill below.

| Skill | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| [expo-overview](references/expo-overview.md) | Router and shared setup rules; the entry point when a request is vague or the user hasn't named a specific Expo tool. |

## Framework (open source)

Free, open-source Expo SDK and React Native skills.
